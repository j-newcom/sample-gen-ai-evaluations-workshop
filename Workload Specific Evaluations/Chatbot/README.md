# Multi-Turn Chatbot Evaluations

## Overview

This module demonstrates how to evaluate multi-turn conversational AI systems using **Strands Agents Evals** and **DeepEval** with Amazon Bedrock. Real users don't interact with chatbots in single turns. They ask follow-ups, change direction, express frustration, and circle back. Evaluating these dynamic patterns requires more than static test cases with fixed inputs and expected outputs.

You'll build a travel booking assistant, simulate realistic multi-turn conversations with it, and evaluate those conversations against domain-specific pass/fail criteria derived from real failure modes.

## Approach

This module follows evaluation practices that have emerged as standard in the industry for production GenAI systems:

- **Evaluate against failure modes, not abstract qualities.** Generic metrics like "helpfulness" or "coherence" measure things that sound meaningful but rarely predict whether a system works for your users. We derive evaluators from concrete failure modes observed in the travel booking domain.
- **Prefer binary pass/fail over numeric scales.** 1-5 Likert scales introduce inter-rater disagreement (is this a 3 or a 4?) and tend to cluster around the middle. Binary pass/fail forces clearer criteria, produces more consistent labels, and is easier to act on.
- **Generate synthetic data along structured dimensions.** Asking an LLM for "some test queries" yields repetitive, low-coverage outputs. Defining dimensions (intent, complexity, user mood, edge cases) and combining them into tuples produces controlled, diverse coverage tied to the behaviors you care about.

## What You'll Learn

- Why multi-turn evaluation is fundamentally harder than single-turn evaluation
- How to build a multi-turn chatbot agent with Strands Agents
- How to simulate realistic conversations with Strands `ActorSimulator` and DeepEval `ConversationSimulator`
- How to design custom binary evaluators from the travel booking domain's real failure modes
- How to generate synthetic test cases from structured dimensions rather than free-form prompts
- How to use `ToolSimulator` for fully simulated end-to-end conversations
- How to build an end-to-end multi-turn evaluation pipeline that reports pass rate per failure mode
